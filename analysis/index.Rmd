Application of `mash` on Blischak, John D., et al. "Mycobacterial infection induces a specific human innate immune response." Scientific reports 5 (2015).

We focus on the time 18 data only.

John treated the individual effect as fixed in the model. Here we implement `mash` with indiviudal as random

# Data
1. Indivivual as random: [Count18_IndRan](Count18_IndRanBayes.html)
2. Indivivual as fixed: [Count18_IndFix](Count18_IndFixBayes.html)

# Mash
1. Indivivual as random EE: [Count18_IndRan_Mash_EE](Count18_Mash_IndRanBayes_EE.html)
2. Indivivual as random EZ: [Count18_IndRan_Mash_EZ](Count18_Mash_IndRanBayes_EZ.html)
3. Indivivual as fixed EE: [Count18_IndFix_Mash_EE](Count18_Mash_IndFixBayes_EE.html)

The Shat in the data are correponding to a t statistics. We transformed them to Shat from the z statistics. If we didn't do the transformation, [Count18_IndFix_Mash_EET](Count18_Mash_IndFixBayes_EET.html)
